📈 AI-Powered Options Trading Analysis Tool
Overview

This project is designed to leverage machine learning techniques and generative AI technologies to perform detailed technical stock analysis, specifically geared towards trading stock options. It integrates historical stock and options data with advanced analytics to provide actionable buy or sell recommendations to traders.

🚀 Application Capabilities

    Historical data retrieval for stocks and option chains.
    Technical indicator analysis: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Support/Resistance.
    Machine Learning (ML) modeling for predictive analytics.
    Generative AI (OpenAI GPT) for intuitive chart-pattern interpretations.
    Clear and actionable trading recommendations for options traders.
    Data visualization: Easy-to-understand charts, indicators, and trade signals.
